# Review Each Job for Improvement Opportunities

## Why Review Job by Job

It is important to review a config file line by line and job by job to ensure no opportunities are missed. After gathering metrics and gathering pain points it can be easy to only focus on problem areas that appear in the metrics. Instead, treat reviewing each job as a function separate from the metric data. This will allow you to find any improvement opportunities that are missed when looking at metrics and validate any assumptions made from the metric data.
