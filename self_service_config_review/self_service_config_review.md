## What is a Configuration Review

A config review is a process where a [project's](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project) [pipeline](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#pipeline) configuration is evaluated for improvement opportunities. Those opportunities are identified through the lens of goals created at the beginning of the review process.

## Why do a Configuration Review

 Config reviews are a key process for maintaining an optimized CI experience. The software you are building and the tools you are using are ever evolving so your pipelines should be evolving with them. Config reviews can help ensure the max value is extracted from every [credit](https://circleci.com/docs/credits/).
