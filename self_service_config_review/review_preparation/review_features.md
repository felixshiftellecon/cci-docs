# Review CircleCI Features

## 1) Look at New Features

CircleCI releases features at a fast pace and there may be something new that can help your [project](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project). Check the [changelog](https://circleci.com/changelog/) for new features and see if any can help with your use case.

## 2) Check the Configuration Reference

The [configuration reference](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/) is a list of all configuration keys available in a CircleCI config file. It can be useful to read through the right sidebar and see if any keys are of interest.

## 3) Record Features of Interest

Record any features of interest for reference throughout the config review. If any recorded features are found not to be helpful, note why for future reference.
