# Document the Config Review

## 1) Create a Document for the Review

Most organizations have more than one [project](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project) on CircleCI and will most likely need to do more than one config review. Creating a format or template that can be used for all config reviews can be helpful to ensure they are standardized.

The following information should be included in the document:
- Goals
- Project metrics
- Job specific recommendations
- High level recommendations
- Place for documentation links

As the config review is conducted, you will most likely find yourself referencing all sorts of documentation both internal and external. Recording the links to those docs can be very helpful for anyone working on the changes after the review or who wants to understand why a certain recommendation was made.
