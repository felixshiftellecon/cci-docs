# Dynamic Config

## Why Dynamic Config

[Dynamic configuration](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/) is an easy way to not have to run a full [pipeline](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#pipeline) when it's not needed, saving [credits](https://circleci.com/docs/credits/) and time. Most projects can benefit from dynamic config but monolith [projects](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project) especially benefit.

## Starting Out

Dynamic config has a wide variety of uses but essentially boils down to creating [pipeline parameters](https://circleci.com/docs/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration) in a setup workflow, then running [workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#workflow) based off those parameters.

To start using dynamic config, CircleCI has an [orb](https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#orbs) that creates parameters based on the paths in the repo where changes have been made. With a little bit of setup you can use the [path filtering orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering) to not have to run your full workflow.

## Advanced Use

Review the pipeline and figure out what parameters could be created and used to trigger conditional workflows and jobs. Create a setup config that generates those parameters then uses the continuation orb to pass them to a downstream workflow.
