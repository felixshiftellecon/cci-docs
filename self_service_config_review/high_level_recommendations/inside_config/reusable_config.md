# Reusable Config Opportunities

## 1) Config SDK

CircleCI config files are written in YAML but that doens't mean they have to be built using YAML. The Config SDK is a javascript/typescript SDK that can be used to generate configuration files. This can be used to generate config manually or, using dynamic config, to generate them each time a pipeline is triggered.

## 2) Orbs

Orbs can be used to share configuration keys across an organization. This is especially useful if all projects need to use a certain tool, like SonarQube. The commands, executors, and parameters required to use the tool can be built into the orb.

CircleCI and our Partners maintain a number of orbs for common tools so reviewing the orb registry is a great way to save yourself some time. Even if you need to create a private orb, the orb registry contains numerous examples to reference from other users.

## 3) Reusable Config

Review the config file for any repeated configuration keys. Repeated keys should be consolidated into a reusable key or added to an orb. Creating [parameterized jobs](https://circleci.com/docs/reusing-config/#authoring-parameterized-jobs) allows for implementation of dynamic config and leads to an easier to manage config in most cases.
