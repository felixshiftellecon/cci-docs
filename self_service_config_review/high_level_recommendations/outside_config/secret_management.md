# Secrets Management

## OIDC

Attempt to replace any static credentials used in CircleCI for connection to cloud environments with authentication using [OIDC tokens](https://circleci.com/docs/openid-connect-tokens/). This is not available for all tools so some credentials may need to remain. A rotation policy should be created for those remaining credentials.

A common and secure alternative to having static credentials in CircleCI is storing them in a secrets manager, like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. OIDC can be used to authenticate with the secrets manager tool and pull secrets into the job.

## Contexts

For github orgs, ensure [contexts](https://circleci.com/docs/contexts/) are restricted to applicable security groups. If possible, migrate important secrets to a secrets manager and use OIDC to pull those secrets into jobs.
